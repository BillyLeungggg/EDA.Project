The objective of this group project is to find out what are the key factors affecting our sleep and how they are related. Also, after analyzing the data,  we would like to see if there is any data lacking so that we cannot dig deeper and find more insight within the dataset.
First step we do some data cleaning  in Python by using pandas, like using “isnull” function  to check missing values and “fillna” function to replace those missing values.
Then we start to plot some graphs through the functions “matplotlib” and “seaborn” , like pie chart, bar and heat map etc. in order to analyze the data in an easier way.
At the end, we found out “Smoking” has the biggest influence among all the habits towards sleeping.
